# League-Manager
An Electron-React Desktop app that creates and manages sports leagues.

## Description

The goal of this application is to manage sports league tables, fixtures, and cup brackets.

## RoadMap

### Basic League

1. ~~Allow users to add players and name their leagues.~~

2. ~~Allow users to generate fixtures based on customizable settings (home/away, single matchup, etc.)~~

3. ~~Be able to see league tables and fixtures once a league is loaded in.~~

4. ~~On updating a fixture, update the league table.~~

5. Allow for table customization (1st place = champion, 2-4 = playoff, 18-20 = relegation, etc.)

6. Consider allowing for TEMPLATES. That way a user does not have to remake a league entirely after the season ends.

### Cups

1. Allow a user to add a cup to their league OR allow them to make a standalone knockout cup.

2. Allow cup brackets to be seeded or randomly generated.

3. Allow for 2 legged ties or single legs.

4. Allow for third place matchups

5. Allow users to customize how they want the cup fixtures to generate. Do they want to be randomly drawn each round or have a fixed setup where 1A will face off against the winner of 2A v 2B?

### Hybrid Leagues

1. Allow a user to create a hybrid league - something similar to the World Cup or NFL, where there is a league season and then a playoff season.

### Divisions

1. Allow for the creation of divisions, ie. A top flight league and a second division that feeds into the top league.

### Other

1. Customize the app based on the sport someone wants to create a league for.
